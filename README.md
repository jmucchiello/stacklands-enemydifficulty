# Enemy Difficulty Mod
Find the enemies the game throws at you to tough? Or maybe you think they're all too easy?

The mod has three options:

## Enemy Strength Multiplier
This setting allows you to modify the relative strength of all enemies in the game from 50% to 300% their normal value.
300% is rather brutal. If you make it far with that setting, bravo!

## No Strength Cap on Post-Witch Forest Waves
Forest Waves have a strength of 20, 30, 40,... up to 110 on the 10th wave where you also face the wicked witch. 
After the wicked witch is defeated, the strength of forest waves becomes random between 30 and 150.
If this setting is ON, the strength of Forest Waves continues to climb at the original rate, 10 + 10 per wave level.

## Witch appears every 10th wave
As it says, when ON, you will face the wicked witch again on waves 20, 30, etc.
Each time she is defeated she gets stronger. (This is in addition to whatever the Enemy Strength multiplier is set to.)

# Start New Round Changes
These setting affect the game as soon as you change them unless you start a new game with the mod installed.

When you hit Start New Round, you can put the Strength Modifier setting in the save file. From then until you start a new run again,
that save file ignores the Mod Options Settings and uses the settings in the save file. When you load the save file, 
a notification informs you what the current multiplier is and whether that information came from the save file or the Mod Options.

## Future Plans
I've been asked if this mod would add special attacks to the enemies. I have not done this and won't unless there are many requests for such a modification.
