# Enemy Difficulty Mod
Find the enemies the game throws at you to tough? Or maybe you think they're all too easy?

The mod has three options:

## Enemy Strength Multiplier
This setting allows you to modify the relative strength of all enemies in the game from 50% to 300% their normal value.
300% is rather brutal. If you make it far with that setting, bravo!

## No Strength Cap on Post-Witch Forest Waves
Forest Waves have a strength of 20, 30, 40,... up to 110 on the 10th wave where you also face the wicked witch. 
After the wicked witch is defeated, the strength of forest waves becomes random between 30 and 150.
If this setting is ON, the strength of Forest Waves continues to climb at the original rate, 10 + 10 per wave level.

## Witch appears every 10th wave
As it says, when ON, you will face the wicked witch again on waves 20, 30, etc.
Each time she is defeated she comes back stronger. (This is on top of whatever the Enemy Strength multiplier is set to.)

## Draggable Enemies
Perhaps not really core to the theme of this mod, being able to move enemies mobs does affect the difficulty of the game for the player.
Thus, this option is included in this mod.

When ON, you can move red mob cards around on the board. This does not allow you to start fights
by dropping red cards on villagers. But, you can move annoying enemies to wherever you would like to
fight them (or avoid fighting them). It also allows you to drag strange portals and pirate ships.

## Future Plans
I've been asked if this mod would add special attacks to the enemies. I have not done this and won't unless there are many requests for such a modification.

# Future Stuff

Like the [Strict Mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026405806) mod, eventually, I will have this mod hook
into Start New Run and have the settings stored in the save file. I plan to do this with several mods to make community challenges
with "bragging rights" verifyable.

List of Mods that will make that possible, some day:

* [Strict Mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026405806) - Can't perform a task until the blueprint for the task is found.
* [Enemy Difficulty](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3044524742) - Allows you to set the strength of enemies to 50% through 300% of their normal strength, among other things.
* [Spawn Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3044203151) - Restrict where enemies spawn. Also control how often Strange Portals and other stuff happens.
* More Quests - Who doesn't want more quests like "Have 500 Food" or "Make 100 Coins in a Single Moon".
* Can't Stop - Disables Pause functionality, can also lock the controls at full speed only.
* Timekeeper - Keeps track of real time game is played, useful for timed challenges.
* Cursed Worlds Difficulty - Adds difficulty to the DLC.
* Challenges - One mod to rule them all. This mod would suggest challenges and set all the settings to get you started. (Or complain you don't have the right mods for the challenge.)
