# Enemy Difficulty Mod
This mod allows you to modify the relative strength of all enemies in the game from 50% to 300% their normal value.
300% is rather brutal. If you make it far with that setting, bravo!

The Tournament Mode setting in the Mod's Options screen causes the strength setting to be saved to the save file, if enabled.
Once saved to the game file, the setting in the Options screen is ignored when playing this save file until the save file is restarted.

# ChangeLog

## Future Plans
I've been asked if this mod would add special attacks to the enemies. I have not done this and won't unless there are many requests for such a modification.
