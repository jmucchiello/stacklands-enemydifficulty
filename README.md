# Enemy Difficulty Mod
This mod allows you to modify the relative strength of all enemies in the game for 50% to 300% their normal value.
300% is rather brutal. Good luck if you make it far with that setting.

I plan to add more difficulty settings to allow enemies to gain Special Hits they normally wouldn't have as an additional
way to make enemies more interesting. But not now in this first release.
